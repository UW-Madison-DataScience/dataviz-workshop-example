# Data Viz Example Workshop


This workshop is a preview of how to use streamlit to create and display interactive plots.

This is a preview of the [Interactive Data Visualizations in Python Lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-interactive-data-visualizations/) currently in the [Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/).
In this demo we will work towards creating [this interactive dashboard of the gapminder data set](https://sstevens2-interact-with-gapminder-data-app-app-zc78i8.streamlit.app/). For UW Audiences, there is also a [version published at UW](https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/test-streamlit-app/).
